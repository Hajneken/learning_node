# MEAN Stack 

*stack* := combination of technologies used to build software 

*Full-Stack* := developer who knows all pieces of software stack 

MEAN: MongoDB, Express, AngularJS and NodeJS

MongoDB : persisting data in documents (JSON)
Express : framework for routing, APIs and HTTP 
AngularJS : front-end (managing the client a.k.a. browser)
NodeJS : JavaScript on the Server, HTTP request and responses 

browsers are written in C++ and do more than just JavaScript engine does

JavaScript does not manipulate the DOM directly: it causes some C++ code to do the manipulation
