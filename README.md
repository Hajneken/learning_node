# Notes and excercises from Learn and Understand NodeJS 

This is a list of excercies and concepts introduced by Anthony Alicea in his course [Learn and Understand NodeJS](!https://www.udemy.com/course/understand-nodejs/).

The notes are sparse and unlike the course itself (aimed at beginners) is more geared towards intermediate practitioners.

* Core Node concepts are captured throughout lessons 1 - 7
* Lesson 8 deals with popular Express framework (server/API management)
* The rest is mostly opinionated and stack dependent (MySQL, MongoDB, Angular)
